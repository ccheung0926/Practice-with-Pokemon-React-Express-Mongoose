# React Pokemons (GEN 1)

Let's get some fun and practice your full stack with our childhood--POKEMON!!

This is exercise for myself to use Mongoose, Express and React. In order to learn a framework productively, the way is to setup everything from scratch and build from groundup.
- setup mongoose and populate 151 pokemons data from pokemon.json to mongoose database (without duplicating the data everytime when you run!!)
- setup express server and get requests
- setup react environment from scratch
- render all the data to your react view

this is a great full-stack exercise. I recommand everyone to just take my pokemon.json file (./data/pokemon.json) and do the same.

How to start?
`npm install`
To run mongoose database
`mongod`
To open mongoDB in terminal
`mongo`
To run express server
`nodemon server/index.js`
To run webpack
`npm run dev`
